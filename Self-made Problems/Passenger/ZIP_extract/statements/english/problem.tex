Petya has to sell at least 1 ticket for each type of passenger.

You are given the bus fare $n$, and 3 numbers $m, w, c$ the number of people at the bus stop, print 3 integers needed to complete the fare.

\InputFile
in the first line, you have one integer $n$ represent the bus fare $(1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)$.

the second line has 3 numbers $m, w, c$ $(1 ≤ m, w, c < n)$ number of men, women, and children at the bus stop (respectively).

\OutputFile
Print a single line consisting of 3 integers the number of men, women, and children needed to complete the fare.


If there is no suitable solution, print "-1".
